 * that stream expand into "what did this worker actually do" without opening a
 * second conversation, a panel, or a window.
 *
 * ## Where the fields come from
 *
 * Two sources, and the distinction matters for honesty:
 *
 *  - **Reported** — the Agent SDK's `task_started` / `task_progress` /
 *    `task_notification` messages, joined to this call by their `tool_use_id`.
 *    These are measurements (`usage.duration_ms`, `tool_uses`, `total_tokens`)
 *    and the provider's own progress prose. Authoritative when present.
 *  - **Rolled up** — derived in the main process from the worker's own child
 *    tool calls (those whose {@link AgentToolCall.parentCallId} is this call's
 *    id), because the renderer must never re-derive orchestration facts.
 *
