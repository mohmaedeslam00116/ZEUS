/**
 * Runtime Telemetry — the provider capability table and the display vocabulary.
 *
 * THE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS TO ENFORCE: the renderer must never learn which
 * provider is running in order to decide what to draw. Main stamps
 * {@link PROVIDER_CAPABILITIES} and {@link CAPABILITY_NOTE} onto every
 * `RuntimeSnapshot`; the renderer reads `snapshot.capabilities` and
 * `snapshot.notes` and nothing else. That makes "no per-provider branches in
 * the UI" structural rather than aspirational, and it means a third adapter
 * contributes its sections — and hides the rest — without a renderer edit.
 *
 * So: `SEGMENT_LABEL` and `SEGMENT_SUBSYSTEM` are renderer-facing.
 * `PROVIDER_CAPABILITIES` and `CAPABILITY_NOTE` are MAIN-ONLY. Importing either
 * of the latter into `src/renderer/**` is the mistake this comment is here to
 * catch in review.

/**
 * What each adapter actually reports. Stamped onto the snapshot by main.
 *
 * Claude: the Agent SDK delivers measured token usage per API request
 * (`message_start.usage`), a per-model `contextWindow` and `maxOutputTokens`
 * (`modelUsage`), rolling quota windows (`rate_limit_event`), compaction
 * boundaries, retries, tool heartbeats and thinking-token estimates.
 *
 * Cursor: `cursor-agent --print --output-format stream-json` emits `system/init`,
 * `assistant`, `tool_call` and `result`. The ONLY quantitative field on the
 * entire stream is `result.duration_ms`. Token counts in that output are an
 * open Cursor feature request, not a shipped capability, and request quotas
 * exist only in the team-scoped Enterprise Admin API — a network call this
 * app deliberately does not make. Everything else is therefore `false`, and
 * the UI says so in words instead of showing a zero.
