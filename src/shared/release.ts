/**
 * The release manifest — the typed shape of "what is in this version".
 *
 * `CHANGELOG.md` is the single source of truth. One parser
 * (`ci/scripts/lib/changelog.mjs`) reads it, and three consumers render it: the
 * GitHub/GitLab release body, `dist/release-manifest.json` published alongside
 * the binaries, and the in-app release document. This file is the contract they
 * agree on, hand-written and reviewed; `releaseManifest.generated.ts` carries
 * only DATA and imports these types.
 *
 * WHY THE MANIFEST IS COMPILED IN RATHER THAN FETCHED. The production CSP is
 * `connect-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data:` (see `hardenSession` in
 * `src/main/index.ts`) — the renderer cannot reach github.com at all, by design.
 * Zeus is local-first and the only network traffic in the product is the
 * connected coding agent talking to its provider. A release document that needed
 * the network would be blank offline, blank in development, and would be the
 * first feature to widen the CSP. So the notes ship inside the build that they
 * describe, and there is nothing to verify at runtime because there is nothing
 * arriving at runtime.
 *
 * THE ONE THING A BUILD CANNOT KNOW ABOUT ITSELF is its own installer's hash: it
 * does not exist until after the build that would have to contain it. So
 * `assets[]` / `signing[]` are populated only in the PUBLISHED manifest
 * (`ci/scripts/generate-release-manifest.mjs`, written into `dist/` before
 * `make-checksums.mjs` so `SHA256SUMS` covers it) and are empty in the embedded
 * copy. The document renders what it has and says where the rest is verified,
 * rather than printing a digest it cannot stand behind.
