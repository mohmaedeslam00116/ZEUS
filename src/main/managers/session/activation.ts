/**
 * The session activation pipeline.
 *
 * Switching sessions changes the *effective execution root* — the worktree a
 * session owns, or the workspace when it owns none — and almost every platform
 * service is bound to that root: the file watcher, the git status cache, the
 * search index, MCP scope, the terminal cwd, the agent's workspace. Retargeting
 * them used to be a synchronous `void` function fanned out from several
 * independent listeners, with the slow parts (`stopWatching`, `indexWorkspace`)
 * simply discarded. Nothing sequenced them, nothing cancelled a stale one, and
 * nothing could tell the renderer that the switch was still in progress — so a
 * fast A→B→A switch could leave the UI showing B's branch against A's status.
 *
 * This module makes activation ONE ordered, awaited operation with a generation
 * counter. Each `activate()` bumps the generation and aborts the previous run;
 * every step re-checks it, so a superseded activation stops quietly instead of
 * writing its results over the newer one.
 *
 * **Activation is not a lock.** The renderer switches immediately and shows the
 * cached snapshot under an "activating" ribbon. A hard gate would turn a slow
 * `git status` or a cold search index into a frozen window, which is worse than
 * briefly-stale data — so the pipeline reports progress and the UI degrades
 * gracefully. What it DOES guarantee is that a terminal event always arrives
 * (it is emitted from `finally`), so the ribbon can never stick.
