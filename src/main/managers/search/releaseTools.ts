/**
 * Release notes as a queryable source — for Global Search, and for the agent.
 *
 * TWO CONSUMERS, ONE IMPLEMENTATION:
 *
 *  - `searchReleases()` is federated into `SearchManager.globalSearch`. Release
 *    notes are already in memory and immutable for the life of the process, so
 *    federating them costs nothing; indexing them into `search_files` would add
 *    a schema, a sync path and an index that can go stale, to search data that
 *    literally cannot change while the app runs.
 *  - `releasePlainTools` is the transport-neutral tool pair, consumed by BOTH
 *    the Claude in-process MCP server and the Cursor bridge dispatcher — the
 *    same pattern `searchTools.ts` and `memoryTools.ts` use, so both agents get
 *    the same answers from the same code.
 *
 * WHY A TOOL AND NOT A CONTEXT BLOCK. Memory, Search and Resume each append a
 * block to the agent's system prompt because their content is selected FOR the
 * current turn. Release notes are not: they are a fixed document that matters
 * only when someone asks about it. Injecting them would put the entire changelog
 * in front of every request forever — which is exactly the bug Claude Code
 * shipped a fix for, where its release-notes view leaked the whole changelog
 * into every subsequent request. So the agent pulls, and only when asked.
 *
 * Read-only by construction: no filesystem, no network, no database. The data
 * is a module constant compiled into this build.
