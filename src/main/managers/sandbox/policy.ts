/**
 * Provider-neutral OS-level Sandbox policy (defense-in-depth Layer 3).
 *
 * Zeus owns ONE sandbox policy and translates it into whichever coding agent
 * runs — Claude's Agent-SDK `Options.sandbox` (Seatbelt on macOS, bubblewrap on
 * Linux/WSL2) and Cursor's `.cursor/sandbox.json` + `--sandbox` flag. This
 * module is the single source of the *effective* policy for a run, so the two
 * provider mappings can never drift.
 *
 * The sandbox is **containment, not authorization**: the permission gate
 * (`AgentManager.decideToolUse`) is always the ultimate authority (Layer 1) and
 * runs on top. The sandbox is the OS-enforced net beneath it — even if a prompt
 * injection or provider defect slipped past the logical permission layer, the
 * kernel still fences the process to the worktree and the configured network.
 *
 * Two things are ALWAYS enforced regardless of user settings (the floor):
 *  - the effective writable root is the session's execution root (the worktree);
 *  - Zeus's own crown jewels — the safeStorage `secrets/` store, `zeus.db`,
 *    and the `settings.json` / `window-state.json` config files — are denied for
 *    read and write.
 * We deny those SPECIFIC paths rather than the whole `userData` root because the
 * session worktree (default `{userData}/worktrees/…`) and the attachment staging
 * dir (`{userData}/attachments/…`) legitimately live under `userData` and MUST
 * stay usable; a blanket `userData` deny would fight the agent's own working dir.
 * Layer 1's `touchesCrownJewel` guard (AgentManager) and Cursor's declarative
 * `sessionDenyRules` both deny this SAME set at the authorization layer — they
 * consume `crownJewelPaths()` directly — so the three layers cannot drift.
 * The user-configurable knobs only ever *widen* writes (extra paths, screened
 * against the floor) or tighten the network — they can never re-expose a crown
 * jewel or escape the worktree.
