/**
 * Per-adapter factory arguments.
 *
 * `loadHarness` derives the factory NAME from the harness id by camel-casing
 * (`claude-code` → `createClaudeCode`, `codex` → `createCodex`, `pi` →
 * `createPi`), which works for all three. What diverges is the ARGUMENTS: each
 * adapter accepts a different set, and passing a key an adapter does not declare
 * is at best ignored and at worst a validation error. So the mapping lives here,
 * in one exhaustive switch, keyed by the registry's `settingsShape` tag.
 *
 * Every shape below was read from the installed package's own `index.d.ts`, not
 * from documentation — the docs and the published types disagreed about
 * `maxTurns` (only claude-code has it) and omitted Pi's `agentDir` entirely.
 *
 * Rule for adding an adapter: read its `.d.ts` first, give it a tag, and pass
 * only keys it declares. Never spread a common object across all three.
