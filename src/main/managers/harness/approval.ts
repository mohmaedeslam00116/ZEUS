/**
 * Answer the harness's permission requests using Zeus's own authority.
 *
 * THE RULE: **`toolApproval` is a ROUTER; `decideToolUse` is the AUTHORITY.**
 * That was already the intent; this file is what finally makes it true.
 *
 * What was wrong before: `toolApproval` is a `Record<string, ToolApprovalStatus>`
 * that the framework LOOKS UP by tool name (`toolApproval?.[toolName]`) — not a
 * callback it invokes. Passing a function meant every lookup returned
 * `undefined`, which normalises to `not-applicable`, which allows. So the gate
 * was never consulted for anything. And built-in tools were never `toolApproval`'s
 * business in the first place: they are governed by `permissionMode`, which was
 * unset and therefore `'allow-all'`.
 *
 * How it works now:
 *  - Built-in tools are gated because `permissionMode` is `'allow-reads'`
 *    (see `permissions.ts`), which makes the adapter emit a
 *    `tool-approval-request` and suspend the turn.
 *  - Custom host tools are gated by listing every one as `'user-approval'` in
 *    the map, which makes the framework emit the same request kind.
 *  - Both kinds land in {@link resolveApproval}, which asks Zeus and returns
 *    the continuation that resumes the turn.
 *
 * Nothing in the map is ever `'approved'` or `'auto-approve'`. Every
 * auto-approval Zeus grants — `autoApproveReads`, `permissionMode: 'auto'`,
 * trusted MCP servers, remembered per-risk choices, the staged-attachment
 * carve-out, `acceptEdits` writes — is a judgement `decideToolUseCore` makes
 * with the tool's inputs, the workspace root, the crown-jewel floor and the
 * session's remembered grants in hand. A static name-keyed map cannot make any
 * of those judgements, and the moment it pretends to, the layers disagree about
 * what was allowed.
