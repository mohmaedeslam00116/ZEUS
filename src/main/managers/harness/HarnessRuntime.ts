/**
 * Drives a run through Vercel AI SDK 7's `HarnessAgent`.
 *
 * The structural twin of `CursorRuntime`: same `start(spec, bridge)` shape,
 * same "the runtime only translates; AgentManager owns everything else"
 * contract. That is what lets `runOnce` dispatch to either without anything
 * downstream — events, persistence, plan artifacts, the Work Graph, Runtime
 * Telemetry, the permission dialogs — knowing which one ran.
 *
 * Three couplings are deliberately narrow, because these packages are
 * experimental and exact-pinned: the option shapes live in `types.ts`, the
 * wire translation lives in `translate.ts`, and the module loading lives in
 * `index.ts`. Nothing else in the app imports the AI SDK.
