/**
 * Runtime loader for the AI SDK harness packages.
 *
 * They are exports-map-only ESM and main is a CJS bundle, so they are loaded
 * through the runtime's native dynamic import — the same `importEsm` trick
 * `AgentManager` uses for `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`, for the same
 * reason: a bare `import()` in TypeScript is rewritten to `require()` by the
 * bundler and fails at runtime. The `new Function` wrapper is what keeps the
 * bundler's hands off it.
 *
 * Loading is lazy and memoised per harness id, so an uninstalled or broken
 * adapter surfaces as a failed run with a named error rather than taking the
 * main process down at boot — the reason `harnessRegistry.ts` holds only
 * module SPECIFIERS and imports nothing.
