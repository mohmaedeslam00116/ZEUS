/**
 * What an adapter's bootstrap commands actually need on the machine, and where
 * to find it.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * The prerequisite check used to be a two-entry table (`pnpm`, `npm`) matched
 * with `command.startsWith('pnpm ')`. Two things were wrong with that. It missed
 * every other tool a command invokes — the claude-code adapter's second command
 * also runs `node` — and it hardcoded one package manager, so an adapter that
 * bootstraps with yarn, bun or corepack would report a clean bill of health and
 * then fail at run time with a non-zero exit from a command the user never saw.
 *
 * THE CONSTRAINT THIS FILE DOES NOT BREAK
 * Zeus never rewrites a bootstrap command. `pnpm install …` is not silently
 * retargeted at `npm`, ever: the consent contract in `bootstrap.ts` is that the
 * string the user approved is the string that executes, and the approval is
 * keyed to a fingerprint of exactly those strings. So "support every package
 * manager" means DETECT AND RESOLVE whatever the plan itself invokes — never
 * substitute one tool for another.
 *
 * The second job here is discovery. `probeCommand` resolves against the Electron
 * process's own PATH, and an app launched from a `.desktop` entry or a Dock icon
 * inherits a far smaller PATH than the user's shell — one that routinely omits
 * `~/.local/share/pnpm`, `~/.bun/bin`, nvm and Homebrew. A pnpm that IS
 * installed then reads as missing. `augmentedPath()` prepends the user-local bin
 * directories that exist, following the install-directory probe idiom
 * `managers/cursor/exec.ts` already uses for `cursor-agent`.
 *
 * This is DISCOVERY, not provisioning: nothing is downloaded, installed or
 * written. CLAUDE.md §1's three outbound requests are untouched.

 * matters because a bootstrap command may be a whole pipeline: in a form like

 * first position and `node` — an actual prerequisite — is the second. (The
 * claude-code plan at 1.0.94 is simpler than that — two flat
 * commands — but the walk is what keeps this version-independent, and the
 * shape above is one adapters have shipped.)
 *
 * Deliberately conservative. This decides what to PROBE, and a false positive
 * becomes a prerequisite the user is told to install for no reason, so the walk
 * stops at the first token that is not a shell word: either it is the
 * executable, or the segment has none worth probing.
 *
 * Anything containing a path separator ends the walk without a result:
 * `./node_modules/.bin/claude` is PRODUCED by the bootstrap, not required
 * before it, and is resolved by the shell against the directory, not PATH.
