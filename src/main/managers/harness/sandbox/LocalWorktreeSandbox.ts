/**
 * A `HarnessV1SandboxProvider` backed by the session's REAL git worktree.
 *
 * Every shipped AI SDK sandbox provider is remote (Vercel) or a local
 * emulation with its own filesystem. Limboo can use neither: it is local-first
 * and makes exactly two kinds of outbound request (CLAUDE.md §1), so the user's
 * repository must never leave the machine — and the agent must edit the actual
 * worktree, because Limboo's whole model is that a session IS a worktree that
 * git, the diff viewer, checkpoints and the Work Graph all observe directly.
 * A provider that copied files in and out would desynchronise all of them.
 *
 * So this provider is a thin, guarded adapter over local `fs` and
 * `child_process` rooted at the worktree. "The sandbox" is this machine, which
 * is exactly why the guards below are not optional.
 *
 * ── The working-directory trick ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * The framework composes a session's cwd as
 * `posix.join(defaultWorkingDirectory, workDir ?? '<harnessId>-<sessionId>')`
 * and REJECTS `workDir: '.'`, so the session always lands in a SUBDIRECTORY of
 * whatever this provider reports as its default. Reporting the worktree root
 * would therefore put the agent in `<worktree>/claude-code-<id>/` — an empty
 * folder inside the repo, not the repo.
 *
 * Hence `defaultWorkingDirectory` is a Limboo-owned STATE ROOT under userData
 * and the caller passes `workDir = basename(worktree)`, which that root holds
 * as a link to the real worktree — so the join lands exactly on the worktree
 * while the adapter's own `.harness-bootstrap` / `.agent-runs` directories
 * stay inside userData and never appear in `git status`. See `stateRoot.ts`
 * for why the link has to be real on disk and why the worktree's plain PARENT
 * is not good enough (a non-worktree session's parent is the user's own
 * projects directory).
 *
 * ── What is guarded, and why each guard exists ───────────────────────────
 *  - Every path resolves through {@link resolvePath}: canonicalized, confined
 *    to the worktree (or the read-only attachments dir), and refused outright
 *    for any `crownJewelPaths()` entry. Layer 1 (`decideToolUse`) governs what
 *    the MODEL may ask for; this governs what the harness process can reach
 *    regardless of who asked.
 *  - `destroy()` NEVER touches disk. `WorktreeManager` owns worktree lifecycle;
 *    a provider that deleted "its" sandbox root would delete the user's work.
 *  - `restricted()` reports the jail's real state, never an optimistic `true`.
 *  - Ports are loopback-only and re-asserted after the bridge starts, and the
 *    bridge's hardcoded `0.0.0.0` bind is rewritten as its file is written.
