/**
 * Where a harness session's adapter state lives, and how the framework's
 * working-directory arithmetic is made to land on the real worktree anyway.
 *
 * ── THE CONSTRAINT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The AI SDK framework composes a session's cwd as
 * `posix.join(defaultWorkingDirectory, workDir)` and rejects `workDir: '.'`,
 * so the session always lands in a SUBDIRECTORY of whatever the provider
 * reports as its default. The adapter then resolves its own state against that
 * same default:
 *
 *   <default>/.harness-bootstrap/claude-code/   (installed CLI + bridge)
 *   <default>/.agent-runs/<sessionId>/bridge/   (per-run bridge state)
 *
 * So "where the state goes" and "where the agent works" are ONE value, and the
 * provider only gets to pick one of them.
 *
 * ── WHY NOT `path.dirname(worktree)` ─────────────────────────────────────
 * That was the original answer, and it is right exactly when the session is
 * worktree-backed: the parent is `{userData}/worktrees/<bucket>`, already
 * Zeus-owned. But `WorktreeManager.resolveSessionRoot` FALLS BACK to the
 * workspace path for a plain session, and then the parent is wherever the user
 * keeps their code — so a first run would create `~/Desktop/.harness-bootstrap/`
 * and `~/Desktop/.agent-runs/` beside their repository, and the provider's own
 * state carve-out would grant the harness read+write to those trees at an
 * arbitrary location on disk.
 *
 * ── THE ANSWER ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Report a Zeus-owned directory as `defaultWorkingDirectory` for EVERY
 * session — worktree-backed or not — and make `<stateRoot>/<basename(root)>` a
 * real on-disk link to the execution root:
 *
 *   {userData}/harness-state/<sha1(realpath(root)).slice(0,12)>/
 *     ├── .harness-bootstrap/…        adapter state, always under userData
 *     ├── .agent-runs/…               adapter state, always under userData
 *     └── <basename(root)>  ─────────▶ the real worktree (symlink/junction)
 *
 * The link must be REAL rather than an in-process alias: the adapter spawns
 * `node bridge.mjs --workdir <stateRoot>/<name>`, and that child `cd`s there
 * itself. A path this process rewrites but the filesystem does not have would
 * fail in the child, where nothing can translate it back.
 *
 * Containment is unchanged by the link. `LocalSandboxSession.resolvePath`
 * canonicalizes with `realpathNearest` BEFORE confining, so
 * `<stateRoot>/<name>/foo` resolves to `<worktree>/foo` and is admitted by the
 * ordinary worktree check — not by a new carve-out. The crown-jewel refusal
 * still runs first and unconditionally.
 *
 * The bucket hash follows `worktree/paths.ts` (`repoBucket`) so both features
 * derive a directory name from a path the same way.
