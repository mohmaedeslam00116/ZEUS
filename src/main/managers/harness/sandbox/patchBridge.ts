/**
 * Rewrite the harness bridge's bind address as it is written into the sandbox.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * `@ai-sdk/harness-claude-code` ships a bridge that opens its control
 * WebSocket with a HARDCODED `new WebSocketServer({ port, host: "0.0.0.0" })`.
 * There is no env var, argv flag, or config option for the bind host — the
 * literal was verified in the published `dist/bridge/index.mjs`. That is the
 * right default for the sandbox providers the adapter was written for (a
 * remote guest, where the port is NAT'd), and the wrong one for a LOCAL
 * provider, where "the sandbox" is the user's own machine and `0.0.0.0` puts a
 * channel that drives the coding agent on the LAN.
 *
 * The other three options were checked and do not work: the adapter takes no
 * bind host; pre-binding `127.0.0.1:<port>` ourselves makes the bridge's own
 * `0.0.0.0` bind fail with EADDRINUSE rather than securing it; and the
 * transport is a TCP WebSocket, so a unix socket is not substitutable.
 *
 * WHY IT IS SAFE TO DO HERE
 * The adapter does not write the file — it hands the CONTENT to the sandbox
 * session's file API, which this provider implements. The rewrite therefore
 * happens at a seam we own, on data already passing through our hands, and it
 * only ever NARROWS what the bridge listens on.
 *
 * WHY IT FAILS LOUD
 * This is a string match against a third-party package's compiled output — the
 * exact thing that breaks silently on an upgrade. So a miss is an ERROR, not a
 * fallback: {@link patchBridgeBindHost} throws when the literal is absent or
 * appears more than once, the run refuses to start, and the port assertion in
 * `ports.ts` independently re-proves the outcome at runtime. Never soften
 * either one into a warning.
