 * and the risk chips all key on the native form, so an unmapped `write` would
 * classify as unknown → `'command'` risk. The consequences are not cosmetic:
 * `autoApproveReads` stops matching reads, `acceptEdits` stops matching edits,
 * every permission chip is mislabelled, and `rememberKey(sessionId, risk)`
 * scopes remembered grants under the wrong risk class.
 *
 * Exactly seven entries; everything else already arrives native-cased
 * (`ExitPlanMode`, `AskUserQuestion`, `Agent`, `WebFetch`, `NotebookEdit`,

 * Restore absolute paths that the framework stripped.

 * The harness rewrites every tool input before it reaches the stream, replacing
 * the session's work dir with `''` or `'.'` — so `Write` on
 * `/…/worktrees/ab/slug/src/x.ts` arrives as `src/x.ts`. That is fine for
 * display inside the agent's own transcript and wrong everywhere Zeus needs a
 * real path: the crown-jewel guard resolves a relative path against
 * `process.cwd()` (the app's directory, not the worktree), and a permission
 * dialog should show the user a path they recognise.
 *
 * Re-absolutising is safe by construction: a relative path from the harness can
 * only ever be worktree-relative, because the worktree IS the CLI's working
 * directory. Only the three keys the path guards actually read are touched;
 * everything else is passed through untouched.
 *
 * `Bash.command` is deliberately NOT repaired. The substitution inside a
 * command string is lossy and irreversible (`cd /…/slug && npm test` arrives as
 * `cd . && npm test`, and `.` is indistinguishable from a `.` the model typed).
 * The guards that read `command` are unaffected: crown-jewel paths live outside
 * the worktree so they are never stripped and stay absolute, and the read-only
 * classifier keys on command names, which never contain the worktree path.
