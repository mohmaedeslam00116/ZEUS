 * The framework throws a plain `Error` for this, so it arrived as anonymous
 * prose and was classified by regex like any other run failure — which is how a
 * setup step that cannot succeed got retried, and how a setup step that failed
 * for a nameable reason got reported as "the run failed".
 *
 * The adapter's own stderr is the most useful thing in the box and is carried
 * verbatim (bounded): the claude-code plan's second command is
 * `./node_modules/.bin/claude --version`, and when the CLI's large
 * platform-native optional dependency did not download — a slow link plus
 * pnpm's per-request fetch timeout is enough — it exits 1 and prints exactly
 * what to do. Swallowing that in favour of a generic message would throw away
 * the answer.
 *
 * Non-retryable on purpose. pnpm records the install as complete even when an
 * OPTIONAL dependency failed, so a re-run reports "Already up to date" and the
 * second command fails identically, forever. Retrying that is a loop, not a
 * recovery; the marker file is never written either way, so the user re-running
 * it deliberately after fixing the cause still gets a full, correct install.
