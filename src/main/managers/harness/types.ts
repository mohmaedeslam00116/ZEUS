/**
 * Hand-written STRUCTURAL declarations for the slice of Vercel AI SDK 7 this
 * app touches.
 *
 * WHY NOT `import type { HarnessAgent } from '@ai-sdk/harness/agent'`:
 * `import/no-unresolved` is an ESLint ERROR in this repo and there is no TS
 * resolver plugin (CLAUDE.md §2), while `moduleResolution` stays `node` (the
 * pre-5.x layout choice, see Issue #10) with
 * `moduleResolution: node`, which cannot read an `exports` map. The harness
 * packages are exports-map-only ESM, so a direct type import fails
 * `npm run lint` — the exact command CLAUDE.md names as the verifier. Declaring
 * the surface here keeps the lint rule tight (rather than widening its ignore
 * list, which is what makes the rule useless over time) and costs nothing at
 * runtime, since the modules are reached through `loadHarness()`.
 *
 * The second reason is containment. These packages are documented as
 * experimental with breaking changes expected between releases, and they are
 * exact-pinned for that reason. When a bump changes a shape, it changes HERE
 * and in `translate.ts`, and nowhere else in the app.
 *
 * Only what is actually used is modelled. Unknown members are deliberately
 * absent rather than typed `any`, so reaching for something unverified is a
 * compile error and not a runtime surprise.
