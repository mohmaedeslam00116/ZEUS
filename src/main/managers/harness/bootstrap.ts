/**
 * The adapter's one-time setup step, and the consent it requires.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * Before its first session, a bridge-backed harness installs the agent CLI into
 * its sandbox state directory. For `@ai-sdk/harness-claude-code` that means
 * running `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` and then the CLI's own installer —
 * i.e. **reaching the npm registry from the user's machine**.
 *
 * Zeus makes exactly three kinds of outbound request, and CLAUDE.md §1 is the
 * paragraph that enumerates them. This is the third, and it is the only one the
 * user can be surprised by, so it is gated the same way repo-authored
 * `zeus.json` commands are: the verbatim commands are shown, the user
 * approves them once, and the approval is keyed to a FINGERPRINT of those exact
 * commands. An adapter upgrade that changes what runs re-prompts, because the
 * thing the user approved is no longer what would execute.
 *
 * The commands are read from the adapter itself (`getBootstrap()`), never
 * hardcoded — a consent dialog that shows something other than what will run is
 * worse than no dialog.
