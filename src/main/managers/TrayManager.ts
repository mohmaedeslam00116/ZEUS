/**
 * TrayManager — adds a system tray icon so Zeus can keep running background
 * work while the window is hidden. Tray support varies by Linux desktop, so all
 * operations are guarded and failures are logged rather than thrown.
 *
 * {@link isActive} is load-bearing, not a convenience: `settings.behavior
 * .minimizeToTray` swallows the window's `close` event, and doing that on a
 * desktop where the tray never appeared would leave Zeus running with no
 * window, no icon, and no way to quit it. The close handler in `src/main/index.ts`
 * asks this class first and only hides when there is genuinely somewhere to hide.
 *
 * The show action goes through an injected callback rather than
 * {@link getMainWindow} alone, because the window can legitimately be GONE (the
 * user quit the last window on macOS, or `minimizeToTray` was off when they
 * closed it). "Show Zeus" that silently does nothing is the same class of bug
 * as an update button that installs nothing.
