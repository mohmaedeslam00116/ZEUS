/**
 * Git availability detection.
 *
 * Zeus's whole engineering surface — history, branches, checkpoints,
 * worktrees, diffs, and every agent collaboration flow built on them — assumes
 * a working `git` binary. When it is missing, {@link GitManager.resolveRoot}
 * gets a failed `rev-parse` and reports `isRepo: false`, which is the SAME
 * signal an ordinary uninitialised folder produces. The UI then offers
 * "Initialize git", which cannot possibly work. This module is what lets the
 * two states be told apart.
 *
 * Deliberately a module function rather than a `GitManager` method: the answer
 * is process-global (is `git` on PATH?), not workspace-scoped, and the result
 * is memoised for the process so panels can ask freely.
