/**
 * Session-scoped Cursor hooks config (`<root>/.cursor/hooks.json`).
 *
 * Hooks give the adapter a synchronous per-tool-call decision point that
 * feeds Zeus's EXISTING permission machinery (risk chips, path guard,
 * auto-approval, the interactive PermissionRequest dialog) — the same
 * semantics Claude gets from canUseTool. Every registered hook runs the
 * bundled hookRunner.cjs, which forwards the payload over the per-run bridge
 * pipe and fails closed.
 *
 * CAPABILITY-GATED: the official docs describe hooks for the IDE and cloud
 * agents; CLI support is undocumented. The bridge therefore only ever
 * TIGHTENS enforcement — whether or not hooks fire, the deny-first cli.json
 * and the propose-only/--force posture remain the enforced baseline. Whether
 * a hook actually connected is recorded per run (see RunBridgeServer).
 *
 * SECURITY: the session hooks.json REPLACES a repo-authored one for the
 * duration of the run (restored byte-for-byte after). Repo-authored hooks are
 * arbitrary commands that would execute outside the zeus.json ack-hash
 * trust gate — merging them in would let any cloned repo run code the user
 * never approved.

/**
 * The gate + observability events the bridge registers.
 *
 * `subagentStart`/`subagentStop` are OBSERVABILITY ONLY and strictly
 * best-effort. Cursor documents them as carrying `task`, `tool_call_id`,
 * `subagent_model` and a set of id fields — but the id fields are reported to
 * all carry the same session id, so parent linkage is not derivable from them,
 * and `subagentStop` is reported not to fire at all for background workers.
 * Zeus therefore treats these as a bonus signal that can enrich a row when it
 * arrives and changes nothing when it does not: no permission decision, no
 * lifecycle state, and no UI that breaks by their absence. Cursor's stream
 * carries no `parent_tool_use_id` analogue, so a Cursor run still renders its
 * tool calls flat, exactly as it did before subagent rows existed.
