/**
 * Cursor CLI capability record — main-process-owned, deliberately NOT in
 * settings (settings.set is renderer-writable over IPC; whether Zeus may pass
 * `--force` is an execution-capability gate, so only verified main-process
 * observations can flip it).
 *
 * The one capability tracked today: "the hooks bridge actually connects for
 * this CLI version". Hook support in the print-mode CLI is undocumented, so
 * default/acceptEdits runs stay propose-only until a run has OBSERVED the
 * bundled hookRunner connect over the per-run pipe. Once verified for a CLI
 * version, later runs may pass `--force` with every tool gated live through
 * `decideToolUse` (fail-closed hookRunner + the deny-first cli.json floor).
 * A CLI update changes the version string, which simply stops matching — the
 * next run is automatically a propose-only re-probe.
