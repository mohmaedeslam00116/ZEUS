/**
 * The Work Graph builder — a PURE reducer from normalized execution events to
 * typed graph nodes and edges.
 *
 * This file is the single home of the event -> node/edge mapping. It has no DB
 * access, no IPC, and no clock (time arrives on the events), so it is trivially
 * testable and cannot stall a run.
 *
 * PROVIDER NEUTRALITY: every signal here arrives from `AgentManager.onEvent()`,
 * which is already normalized across both adapters — Cursor's `translate.ts`
 * maps Cursor's tool-union keys onto Claude-shaped tool names before the event
 * is pushed. So ONE mapping table serves both providers, and any future adapter
 * that emits `AgentEvent` contributes nodes for free. The Hook Engine bus is
 * used only for ENRICHMENT (approval decisions, checkpoints) — never as a sole
 * source, because it is gated on `settings.agent.hookEngine.enabled` and the
 * graph must be complete with hooks turned off.
 *
 * HONESTY RULES enforced here:
 * - An edge is `derived: true` unless it was read straight off an event.
 * - `terminal.meta.exitCode` is left undefined for agent commands: the Agent
 *   SDK does not stream tool stdout, so there is no real exit code to report.
 * - Cursor print mode has no subagents, so no `subagent` node is ever synthesized
 *   for a Cursor run.
