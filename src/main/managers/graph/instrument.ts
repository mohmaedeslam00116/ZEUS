/**
 * Internal-MCP instrumentation for the Work Graph.
 *
 * Zeus's own MCP tools (`zeus_memory`, `zeus_search`) are exposed over
 * TWO transports — the SDK's in-process servers for Claude runs, and the stdio
 * bridge dispatcher for Cursor runs — but both call the SAME `PlainTool.run`.
 * Wrapping `run` once therefore captures every internal MCP invocation on both
 * providers, which is why the tools were factored into `PlainTool` in the first
 * place.
 *
 * ENRICHMENT, NOT INGESTION. Internal MCP calls also arrive on the primary
 * `AgentManager.onEvent()` path as `tool-start`/`tool-end` on `mcp__zeus_*`
 * names, so this wrapper's job is to add what that path lacks — the real
 * execution duration and the result size — not to create duplicate nodes. If
 * the wrapper were removed entirely the graph would still show every call.
 *
 * The wrapper is transparent: it never alters args, never alters the return
 * value, and never swallows an error. A failing observer must not be able to
 * change what a tool returns to a model.
