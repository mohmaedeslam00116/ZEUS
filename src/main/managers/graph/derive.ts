 * same authority as an event Zeus actually observed.
 *
 * WHAT IS AND IS NOT HERE. `verified-by` has no provider signal at all — neither
 * Claude nor Cursor tells a host "this command validated that edit". So it is
 * derived from three REAL facts (a command's actual text, its actual success,
 * and its actual position after a file change) rather than guessed. Conversely,
 * there is deliberately no attempt to infer intent, causality between unrelated
 * tools, or "which task this edit belongs to": those would be fabrication, not
 * inference, and the graph would be worse for containing them.
