 * adapter packages are reached through the runtime dynamic import in
 * `harness/index.ts`, so an uninstalled or broken adapter degrades to "not
 * available" rather than taking the main process down at boot.
 *
 * A harness is HOW a model is run, and it is distinct from the provider (WHO
 * serves the model). Two harnesses can share a provider — `claude-code` (via
 * the AI SDK adapter) and the direct Claude Agent SDK path are both
 * `anthropic`. And a provider can have no harness at all: **Cursor has no AI
 * SDK adapter and none is announced**, so it stays a first-class `native`
 * runtime behind the same {@link ProviderRunBridge} seam rather than being
 * migrated or dropped.
