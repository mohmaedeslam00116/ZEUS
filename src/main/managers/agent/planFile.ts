/**
 * Plan-file plumbing for Claude runs.
 *
 * Current Claude Code / Agent SDK builds do NOT pass the plan through
 * `ExitPlanMode`'s input — the tool's declared schema is
 * `{ allowedPrompts?: … /* deprecated *\/; [k: string]: unknown }` with no
 * `plan` field. The plan is written to a FILE, and the tool's *output* carries
 * `plan` / `filePath`. Reading `input.plan` therefore captures an empty string,
 * and because Zeus denies the tool the output never exists either.
 *
 * The fix is to stop guessing where the plan is. `Settings.plansDirectory`
 * ("Custom directory for plan files, relative to project root. If not set,
 * defaults to ~/.claude/plans/") lets the host CHOOSE the location, so:
 *
 *   1. the plan file is inside the session root, at a path we control;
 *   2. it exists on disk before `ExitPlanMode` is called, so the approval gate
 *      can show the user real markdown instead of scraping narration;
 *   3. containment is trivially satisfied — we are not accepting a path from
 *      the model, we are dictating one.
 *
 * The settings file itself is generated per run through `withSessionFile`, the
 * same snapshot/atomic-write/restore helper every Cursor session file uses, so
 * the working tree ends each run exactly as it started.
