/**
 * The provider seam: run-scoped callbacks a provider runtime uses to report
 * what happened, without knowing anything about how Zeus records it.
 *
 * All streaming / tool / persistence / telemetry behaviour stays owned by
 * `AgentManager`; a runtime only translates its own wire format into these
 * calls. That is what lets Cursor's print-mode NDJSON, the Claude Agent SDK's
 * message stream, and any future adapter share one implementation of the
 * conversation timeline, the permission gate, the Work Graph and the Runtime
 * panel.
 *
 * This interface lived in `cursor/types.ts` while Cursor was the only adapter
 * behind the seam. It is provider-neutral, so it lives here now;
 * `cursor/types.ts` re-exports it and no Cursor import changed.
 *
 * EXTENSION RULE: every member added for a new adapter must be OPTIONAL. An
 * existing runtime's bridge object has to keep satisfying the type untouched —
 * a required addition would silently make the older adapter a compile error and
 * tempt a stub implementation that lies about what it observed.
