/**
 * The identity block at the top of a release document: what this version is,
 * where it came from, and how far you can trust that answer.
 *
 * Facts are split into two groups on purpose, because they have different
 * warrants. RELEASE facts (version, date, channel, tag, commit, build number)
 * come from the manifest compiled into this build at package time. BUILD facts
 * (platform, architecture, Electron/Chromium versions, packaged state) are read
 * from the running process by the main process. Mixing them into one undated
 * table would make a claim about the artifact you downloaded and a claim about
 * the process you are running look like the same kind of statement.
