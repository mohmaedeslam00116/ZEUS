/**
 * A labelled, collapsible container for a multi-paragraph BODY in the
 * conversation stream.
 *
 * ## The rule this refines
 *
 * The stream's contract is that rows sit at its own typographic weight and are
 * never cards — that is what makes a turn read as a timeline instead of a stack
 * of boxes, and `PlanInline` / `SubagentActivity` both state it. That rule is
 * about ROWS, and it stands.
 *
 * A body is not a row. A subagent's returned summary, its forwarded transcript,
 * and an approved plan are documents: several paragraphs of Markdown, headings,
 * task lists. Rendered flush against the stream with a `10px` uppercase label
 * above them and metadata rows below, they had no boundary at all — prose ran
 * into structure, and the reader had to work out where one ended. So: **rows are
 * never cards; bodies are.**
 *
 * ## Why not just a max-height
 *
 * The previous shape was `max-h-72 overflow-y-auto` — a nested scroller inside
 * the conversation's own scroller. It traps the wheel, gives no indication that
 * anything is below the fold, and offers no way to see the rest. This clamps
 * with a fade and an explicit control instead, so the reader always knows there
 * is more and can always get to it.
 *
 * Uses the house card idiom (the Tasks drawer's "Implementation plan" section):
 * `rounded-md border border-line bg-surface-2/50`, an uppercase header strip
 * that toggles, and a `border-t` body. Theme tokens only, no shadows.

   * Bare exists because inside a subagent's execution record the surround was
   * doing damage rather than work: `validation`, `files changed` and `tool
   * calls` are already plain labelled sections there, so boxing only the
   * transcript and the summary made two of the record's sections look like a
   * different KIND of thing. A container earns its border when it separates a
   * document from unrelated content around it — not when everything around it
   * is the same document.
