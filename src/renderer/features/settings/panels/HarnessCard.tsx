/**
 * One harness in Settings › Agent › Harnesses.
 *
 * Replaces the two hand-rolled provider cards with a single shape: the shared
 * {@link ProviderStatusRow} on top (icon, name, live status, status pill) and a
 * slot beneath for whatever that harness needs configured. Previously the
 * Claude row was an inline status row with a hardcoded string while Cursor was
 * a 321-line bespoke card, so the two could not look alike or stay in step.
 *
 * Despite the name it is NOT a card: no border, no fill, no radius. Settings
 * panels are flat lists of labelled rows, and a bordered well here was the one
 * thing making this category look different from every other. Grouping is
 * carried by a hairline between harnesses instead.
 *
 * A harness with no adapter renders as "Not available" rather than being
 * hidden: this section is the DISCOVERY surface, and silently omitting a
 * harness makes "not installed" indistinguishable from "does not exist".
 * (CLAUDE.md's "the UI never knows which agent is running" rule governs the
 * conversation surfaces — Settings is where the choice is made.)
