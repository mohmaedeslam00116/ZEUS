/**
 * Claude Code harness controls — the body of the Claude card in
 * Settings › Agent › Harnesses.
 *
 * Claude Code needs no authentication UI (Zeus reuses the CLI's own local
 * login and stores no Anthropic credentials), so this carries the knobs that
 * decide HOW an Anthropic model runs, plus the one-time approval for the
 * harness's setup step.
 *
 * The setup commands are read from the ADAPTER, never hardcoded here — a
 * consent surface that shows something other than what will run is worse than
 * no consent surface. Approving stores a fingerprint of those exact commands,
 * so an adapter upgrade that changes them asks again.
 *
 * EVERY BRANCH BELOW MAKES A DIFFERENT CLAIM, and they used to be one. The
 * "installs nothing" line was the else-leg of a single ternary, so it also
 * rendered for a request still in flight, a rejected IPC, a different harness
 * being selected, and an adapter that threw while describing itself — the last
 * of which shipped, and printed "This harness needs no setup step." directly
 * under a paragraph describing the setup step. Keep the states apart.
