/**
 * Shared helper: write `resources/app-update.yml` into a packaged ZEUS app dir.
 *
 * electron-updater reads `<resources>/app-update.yml` on every checkForUpdates()
 * to learn its feed + cache dir. electron-builder normally writes this file during
 * its own app-packaging step — but ZEUS's hybrid flow never uses that step:
 * Electron Forge packages the app, and electron-builder only runs `--prepackaged`
 * (installers only, no re-pack). So the file is emitted by neither tool and must
 * be written manually.
 *
 * This helper is the single source of truth for that file. It is called from BOTH:
 *  - `forge.config.ts` `hooks.postPackage` — so EVERY Forge-packaged output has it
 *    (covers `npm run package`, running from `out/`, and the base of `npm run dist`).
 *  - `scripts/dist.mjs` — a redundant safety net before electron-builder wraps it.
 *
 * Content mirrors electron-builder's own output, derived from the `publish` block
 * in electron-builder.yml.
