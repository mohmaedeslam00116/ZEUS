/**
 * Bundle the release documentation the app ships, from the single source of
 * truth: CHANGELOG.md.
 *
 *   node scripts/gen-release-notes.mjs           (npm run gen:notes)
 *   node scripts/gen-release-notes.mjs --check   (CI: fail if out of sync)
 *
 * Output — both COMMITTED:
 *   src/shared/releaseNotes.generated.ts     the most recent N sections as Markdown
 *   src/shared/releaseManifest.generated.ts  the same releases, structured, plus
 *                                            an index of every released version
 *
 * TWO FILES, NOT ONE. The Markdown blob is the fallback and the export/copy
 * source — it is what the changelog literally says, and it must survive a
 * generator that learns to parse something incorrectly. The manifest is the
 * structured view the release document renders. Keeping both means a parsing
 * bug degrades the page to plain notes instead of losing the release entirely.
 *
 * WHY A GENERATED MODULE RATHER THAN A BUNDLED ASSET. `electron-builder.yml`
 * deliberately declares no `files`/`extraResources` block — it repacks Forge's
 * output via `--prepackaged` so the security fuses and asar integrity Forge
 * baked in survive. A data file copied for packaging would therefore need a
 * second mechanism (and a runtime path that differs between dev, asar, and
 * asar-unpacked). An imported module needs none of that and behaves identically
 * everywhere.
 *
 * WHY NOT READ THE UPDATER'S NOTES INSTEAD. `UpdateInfo.releaseNotes` describes
 * the version being *offered*, is HTML-stripped and capped on its way through
 * the updater, and lives only in memory — so it is gone by the time the new
 * version boots and cannot answer "what did I just get?". Bundled notes always
 * match the running build, need no network, and work in development.
 *
 * WHY `--check` EXISTS. Regenerating was a manual checklist item with nothing
 * enforcing it, so a changelog edit could ship with stale in-app notes and
 * nobody would find out until after the release. CI runs `--check` in the
 * validate stage; it writes nothing and exits non-zero on any drift.
 *
 * The generated files are COMMITTED so they are reviewable in a diff and so a
 * build never depends on this script having been run.
