; ZEUS — custom NSIS include, merged into electron-builder's well-tested NSIS
; script via the `nsis.include` option. Keep this minimal and additive: the base
; script already handles install/upgrade/uninstall, shortcuts, and the assisted
; multi-page wizard. We only layer on brand identity here.
;
; electron-builder invokes these named macros at the right points in its script.

; Branded run-after-finish prompt (shown on the final wizard page).

; Runs before any files/shortcuts are written. Older builds installed under the
; lowercase "limboo" identity (and under a Start-menu vendor subfolder while
; menuCategory was on) — those stale shortcuts are what made Start's "Recently
; added" launch an outdated, Electron-branded exe. Scrub them here so an
; upgrade always leaves exactly one root-level "ZEUS" identity. Deleting
; non-existent paths is a no-op in NSIS, and this runs BEFORE the new shortcuts
; are created, so the case-insensitive filesystem can't eat the fresh links.
