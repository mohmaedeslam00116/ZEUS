# Auto-update

> **ZEUS status (#13, ADR-0006):** ZEUS inherits the auto-update *client*
> implementation and its packaging invariants, but there is **no update feed
> and no release publishing yet** — the inherited Zeus feed is intentionally
> not served to ZEUS users. The invariants below are preserved as reference

How Zeus updates itself, what differs per platform, and the invariants that
must not be broken. Implementation:
[`src/main/managers/AutoUpdateManager.ts`](../../src/main/managers/AutoUpdateManager.ts).

Zeus uses `electron-updater` against this repository's GitHub Releases. The
feed is public and read-only, so no update credentials are stored anywhere.

## The flow

1. Eight seconds after launch (and hourly after that, if **Check automatically**
   is on) the app fetches `latest.yml` / `latest-mac.yml` / `latest-linux.yml`
   from the latest release.
2. A newer version surfaces as a bottom strip and a Settings badge.
3. The download runs in the background, with progress on the taskbar/dock.
4. **Restart & install** hands the staged installer to the OS and quits.

Polling is suspended while an update is staged. Re-checking would re-emit
`update-available` for the version already downloaded and move the state machine
off `downloaded`, which is what used to turn the install button into a silent
no-op.

## Channels: stable and beta

`settings.updates.channel` is `stable` (default) or `beta`, and it maps to exactly
one electron-updater knob: `allowPrerelease`. The GitHub provider skips
prereleases entirely unless that is set, so **publishing a prerelease cannot
affect a stable install** — there is no second feed file, no `beta.yml`, and no
electron-builder change. A beta install reads the prerelease's own `latest*.yml`
like any other release.

A prerelease is any tag carrying a suffix (`v1.18.0-beta.1`). That is already how
`channelForTag` derives the release document's channel, and how all three
publishers decide `--prerelease` — the rule is "does the tag contain a hyphen",
and nothing new was added for it.

**A beta is never auto-downloaded.** `autoDownloadFor()` in `AutoUpdateManager`
forces `autoDownload` off on this channel regardless of the user's preference,
and the Settings toggle is disabled with that stated. Three reasons:

- An unreleased build is a per-version decision. A preference set once should not
  silently apply to every future prerelease.
- The strip offers the release notes beside the download, because for a
  prerelease those notes are load-bearing rather than informational.
- A partial download is not silently resumed either (the `resuming` path checks
  `prerelease`), since resuming would apply an earlier choice to a version the
  user has not seen.

Once a beta is **installed**, it updates normally — choosing the channel was the
consent. Switching back to stable stops new beta offers; it does not downgrade the
running build, and electron-updater will not offer an older version.

`UpdateStatus` carries three fields so the renderer never reads settings or parses
a version to phrase an offer: `channel`, `prerelease` (the OFFER) and
`runningPrerelease` (the RUNNING build). Those are independent — a beta install
can be offered a stable release, and the two cases read differently.

`SettingsManager.normalize` accepts only the literal `'beta'`; anything else falls
back to stable, so a hand-edited `settings.json` cannot widen what an install is
offered.

The release document shows a warning block above the summary for any non-stable
channel: that the build is not released, that features may be reverted, and that
settings/session data migrate forward but not back. It is prose in a bordered
block rather than a coloured pill, per the no-badge rule in `release/parts.tsx` —
the wording has to survive a screenshot and the Markdown export.

## Per-platform mechanics

| Platform | Mechanism | Requires |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows (NSIS) | Runs the downloaded installer with `--updated /S --force-run` | — |
| macOS | Squirrel.Mac, fed the update zip over a loopback proxy | **A valid code signature** |
| Linux AppImage | Replaces the AppImage in place, then re-execs it | `APPIMAGE` in the environment |
| Linux deb / rpm / pacman | **Zeus's own installer** (`managers/updates/linuxInstall.ts`) runs `dpkg`/`apt-get`, `dnf`/`zypper`/`yum`/`rpm`, or `pacman` under `pkexec` | `pkexec` (polkit) |
| Microsoft Store (MSIX) | **Disabled** — the Store owns updates | — |

Windows uses silent mode deliberately. Zeus's NSIS installer is the assisted
(multi-page) kind, and a non-silent update re-runs the whole wizard, which reads
to users as "clicking the button did nothing".

## Invariants

### macOS builds must be signed

Squirrel.Mac refuses to install an update into an app whose signature it cannot
verify. An unsigned or ad-hoc-signed macOS build therefore *cannot* self-update,
no matter how healthy the rest of the pipeline is. `AutoUpdateManager` probes
this at startup with `codesign -dv` and reports updates as disabled with a
reason, rather than offering a button that fails after a ~240 MB download.

### macOS update zips must be rooted at `Zeus.app/`

Squirrel.Mac unpacks the zip and expects the `.app` at its root. This is decided
by what `scripts/dist.mjs` passes to `electron-builder --prepackaged`: on macOS
that value is treated as the `.app` bundle path, not as a containing directory.
Passing the directory produces a zip rooted at `Zeus-darwin-arm64/`, which
downloads and verifies perfectly and then never installs.

`ci/scripts/verify-artifacts.mjs` asserts the zip root on every release.

### Windows must not advertise a `publisherName`

`electron-updater` runs an Authenticode check on the downloaded installer only
when `app-update.yml` carries a `publisherName`, and that check requires
`Get-AuthenticodeSignature ... Status == Valid`. The current Windows signing
route is a self-signed certificate, which is in no user's trust store and so can
never be Valid. Publishing a `publisherName` alongside it makes **every** Windows
update fail with "New version is not signed by the application owner", and the
only fix for an affected user is a manual reinstall.

Omitting the key is not sufficient on its own: at its default `true`,
`win.verifyUpdateCodeSignature` makes electron-builder *derive* `publisherName`
from the signing certificate's CN and write it into `app-update.yml` for you.
`electron-builder.yml` therefore pins `verifyUpdateCodeSignature: false`, and
`scripts/signing.cjs` turns it back on only for the Azure Trusted Signing route,
where the chain genuinely is trusted.

`ci/scripts/verify-signing.mjs` asserts both halves on every build.

### No architecture may be published under another's name

With `--prepackaged`, an explicit `arch:` list in a target overrides the CLI arch
flag, and electron-builder wraps the same single-architecture directory once per
listed arch. That is how v1.5.1 shipped an "Intel" dmg and zip that were
byte-identical to the arm64 build. Every target list in `electron-builder.yml` is
deliberately arch-free; the architecture comes from `scripts/dist.mjs` and the CI
matrix supplies one runner per architecture.

`ci/scripts/verify-artifacts.mjs` fails the build if two artifacts in a feed
share a sha512.

### Update feeds must be merged, never overwritten

Each runner writes a feed describing only the artifacts it built. Uploading the
Intel runner's `latest-mac.yml` over the Apple-silicon runner's does not add
Intel support — it removes arm64 from the feed. `ci/scripts/merge-update-metadata.mjs`
unions the `files:` arrays; the release-supplement workflow runs it against the
feeds already attached to the release.

## Which Linux updater runs

`electron-updater`'s own dispatch reads `{resources}/package-type` and lets it
**override** the AppImage default. In this repo's hybrid build every Linux target
shares one staged app directory, so electron-builder's `FpmTarget` can leave a
stale `deb`/`rpm` marker inside the AppImage.

`AutoUpdateManager` therefore selects the implementation itself, in this order:

1. `APPIMAGE` is set → `AppImageUpdater` (if we are running as an AppImage, that
   is what has to be replaced, whatever marker file is baked in).
2. `{resources}/package-type`, **cross-checked against the host's real tooling**
   (`detectPackageFormat` in `managers/updates/linuxInstall.ts`) →
   `DebUpdater` / `RpmUpdater` / `PacmanUpdater`. A marker naming a package
   manager this machine does not have is not trusted; the host decides instead.
   Without the cross-check a stale `rpm` marker on an Arch box selects
   `RpmUpdater`, which downloads the `.rpm`, prompts for a password, and *then*
   reports `zypper: command not found`.
3. Neither → updates disabled, with a reason.

## Linux package installs do NOT go through electron-updater

`quitAndInstall()` is used on Windows, macOS, and AppImage only. For deb / rpm /
pacman the update is applied by `managers/updates/linuxInstall.ts`, because
electron-updater's own path has four properties a desktop app cannot ship with:

1. It runs the package manager with **`spawnSync` + `shell: true`**, wrapped in
   `/bin/bash -c '<joined argv>'`. That blocks the whole main process for the
   entire authorization — measured at 19 s — so the window is frozen while the
   polkit dialog is up and the prompt can land behind a dead app.
2. On failure it immediately fires a **second** privileged command
   (`pacman -Sy`) — a second password prompt for a database sync nobody asked
   for.
3. With no graphical helper it falls back to plain `sudo` with piped stdio,
   which blocks forever on a password it can never read.
4. `RpmUpdater` picks the **first** entry of its priority list when none of the
   package managers exist, so a host with no rpm tooling still prompts before
   failing.

Zeus's replacement is argv-only (never `shell: true`, per CLAUDE.md §6),
**asynchronous** so the renderer can paint the `installing` stage, single-shot
(no retry chain, therefore one prompt), and `pkexec`-only — gksudo/kdesudo take
the command as a shell-quoted string, which is the very thing being removed.

Two consequences are load-bearing:

- **`autoInstallOnAppQuit` is `false`** whenever the Linux package path is
  active. electron-updater's quit handler runs the same synchronous privileged
  install, so leaving it on meant every ordinary quit threw a password prompt at
  the user and blocked shutdown behind it.
- **The quit watchdog is armed only after the handoff is confirmed.** It used to
  fire unconditionally, so `app.exit(0)` killed the app four seconds after an
  install the package manager had already *refused* — the app vanished, still on
  the old version, with nothing on screen to explain it.

When the install cannot succeed, `UpdateStatus.manualCommand` carries the exact
line that will (`sudo pacman -U <staged file>`), rendered and copyable in the
update ribbon. It is display text: main composes it, the renderer never sends it
back, and nothing executes it.

### Linux package dependencies are an update invariant

A `.pacman` / `.deb` / `.rpm` that cannot resolve its own dependencies is an
update that can never install, no matter how well the updater behaves. v1.7.0
shipped exactly that: `electron-builder.yml` declared no `pacman:` block, so
app-builder-lib's default `depends` applied — and two of its entries,
`http-parser` (dropped from Arch) and `libappindicator-gtk3` (AUR-only), do not
exist in the Arch/Manjaro repos. Every pacman self-update failed with
`cannot resolve "http-parser", a dependency of "zeus"`.

`electron-builder.yml` now declares `pacman.depends` explicitly. Anything added
there must exist in `core`/`extra` — verify before shipping:

```bash
bsdtar -xOf dist/zeus-*-x64.pacman .PKGINFO | grep '^depend'
```

## AppImage filenames change on update

The new AppImage lands under the new release's filename and the old file is
deleted, so a `.desktop` entry or dock pin aimed at the old path stops working.
This is standard AppImage behaviour, not a failure — the app listens for
`appimage-filename-updated` and notifies the user of the new path.

## Reproducing an update locally

```bash
npm run dist -- --publish never
node ci/scripts/verify-artifacts.mjs dist

./dist/zeus-*.AppImage                        # run from a terminal
tail -f ~/.config/Zeus/logs/zeus-main.log   # watch the [updater] lines
```

A healthy install logs `[updater] using AppImageUpdater`, then
`Install on explicit quitAndInstall`, then the process exits and a new one
starts. Updates are inert in dev (`npm start`) — there is no `app-update.yml`
outside a packaged build, and the Settings panel says so.

## Why quitting is now forced

`quitAndInstall` spawns the replacement process **synchronously** and only then
defers `app.quit()` to the next tick. Two things used to go wrong there:

- The new process lost the `requestSingleInstanceLock()` race against the still
  running old one and quit itself. The lock is now released *before* the handoff,
  and the `second-instance` handler ignores events while an update is in flight.
- A throwing disposer in `before-quit` aborted the rest of the teardown and got
  swallowed by the global `uncaughtException` handler, leaving the process alive
  with an installer waiting on it. Each disposer is now individually contained,
  and a watchdog forces `app.exit(0)` if the process is still up four seconds
  after the handoff.

## After the update: the release document

An update that installs silently and says nothing is a maintenance task. Zeus
turns it into a workspace document instead.

**The rule.** On launch, once settings have hydrated, the renderer compares
`app.getVersion()` against `settings.updates.lastSeenVersion`. When they differ and
this build carries notes for the running version, the release document opens once as
a workspace tab. Closing it acknowledges the version. Nothing else opens it
automatically; the command palette (`What's New in this version`) is the way back.

Three details that are easy to get wrong, and are handled:

- **Dismissal is detected as an open→closed transition**, not wired to the close
  button — so the X, middle-click, "close others", "close all" and the palette all
  count as acknowledgement. A close button that only worked when clicked directly
  would silently reopen the tab forever.
- **Auto-open is latched per app run** (module scope, not component state):
  `CenterWorkspace` remounts on layout changes, and the version is not marked seen
  until the tab is closed, so without the latch closing it would immediately reopen
  it.
- **The tab is never persisted.** `useDocumentStore.persist()` skips
  `release-notes` refs explicitly, and `PersistedDocumentKind` cannot represent them
  — reopening it every launch is exactly what "dismiss until the next update" exists
  to prevent.

**Why the notes are compiled in rather than downloaded.** `UpdateInfo.releaseNotes`
describes the version being *offered*, is HTML-stripped and capped on its way
through the updater, and lives only in memory — so it is gone by the time the new
version boots and can never answer "what did I just get?". The bundled data always
matches the running build, needs no network, and works in development. The
production CSP (`connect-src 'self'`) means there is no other option that would
work anyway.

**What it shows, and what it refuses to show.** The document renders the release
manifest (see [release-process §4b](../ci/release-process.md#4b-the-release-manifest)):
version, channel, tag, commit, build number, the structured changelog sections,
contributors, pull requests and merged branches. Per-asset SHA-256 digests are NOT
in the bundled manifest — a build cannot contain the hash of an installer produced
from it — so the Verification section shows the `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS` and
`gh attestation verify` commands and links to the release page instead of printing a
digest it cannot stand behind. Facts about the *running process* (platform, arch,
Electron/Chromium versions, packaged state, macOS signing authority) come from
`update:getBuildInfo` and are shown in their own group, because a claim about a
download and a measurement of what is executing are different kinds of statement.

**The document is display-only.** It is never added to an agent context provider.
Claude Code shipped a fix for exactly that bug, where its release-notes view
injected the whole changelog into every subsequent request. The agent can still
answer "what changed in 1.7.0?" — by calling the read-only `list_releases` /
`release_notes` tools on the `zeus_search` MCP server when it is actually asked.
