# Security model

Limboo is local-first, which makes its attack surface small, and it is hardened in
depth so that even a compromised renderer cannot reach the OS. This page consolidates
the threat model and the enforcement patterns. None of these may be weakened by a
change. The user-facing summary is [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md).

## Threat model in one paragraph

There is no backend, no server-side application telemetry, and no stored
credentials, so there is no server to attack and little secret material to
steal. **Runtime Telemetry** is a local-only platform service: it measures
ZEUS's own agent runs (context usage, cost estimates, quota windows) into the
local SQLite database, is displayed only in the app, and never leaves the
machine — the privacy/local-first model is unchanged. The realistic threats are: a
compromised or buggy renderer trying to reach the OS; malicious input crossing IPC;
path traversal escaping the workspace; injection through SQL or a spawned shell;
prototype pollution through merged objects; and secrets leaking into logs. Each has a
specific, implemented defense. The operational form — every invariant mapped
to its enforcement anchor and verification method, plus the Security-impact
contract and the ADR-0004 regression protocol — is
[`docs/security/invariants.md`](../security/invariants.md).

## The eleven hardening patterns

1. **Process isolation** — `contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`,
   `sandbox: true`. The renderer has no Node access; a single typed preload bridge is
   the only path to main.
   ([`createWindow.ts`](../../src/main/window/createWindow.ts))

2. **IPC sender validation** — the `handle()` wrapper rejects any message whose
   sender origin is not the app's own renderer (dev-server origin in dev, `file://`
   in prod). ([`ipc/registry.ts`](../../src/main/ipc/registry.ts))

3. **Deny-by-default permissions** — `hardenSession()` refuses all web-platform
   permission requests and checks (camera, microphone, geolocation, USB, and so on).
   ([`src/main/index.ts`](../../src/main/index.ts))

4. **Navigation and webview lockdown** — `will-navigate` and `will-redirect` are
   guarded, `setWindowOpenHandler` denies in-app navigation (external links open in
   the OS browser), and `<webview>` attachment is blocked.
   ([`createWindow.ts`](../../src/main/window/createWindow.ts))

5. **Content-Security-Policy** — strict `self`-only in production (no eval); relaxed
   only for Vite HMR in development. ([`src/main/index.ts`](../../src/main/index.ts))

6. **No shell execution** — git, the terminal, and the Cursor CLI are spawned with
   argv arrays via `execFile` / `spawn` / `node-pty`, never `shell: true`, so there
   is no shell string to inject into. Windows `.cmd` shims for `cursor-agent` are
   bridged through `%ComSpec%` only when every argument matches a static-literal
   whitelist. ([`managers/git/exec.ts`](../../src/main/managers/git/exec.ts),
   [`managers/cursor/exec.ts`](../../src/main/managers/cursor/exec.ts),
   [`TerminalManager.ts`](../../src/main/managers/TerminalManager.ts))

7. **Path-traversal guards** — every renderer-supplied path is validated to stay
   inside the workspace / repository root, symlink-aware, rejecting absolute paths,
   parent traversal, null bytes, and over-long paths (`assertInsideRepo`,
   `isInsideRoot`).

8. **Parameterized SQL** — only bound statements; values are never concatenated into
   SQL. ([`db/database.ts`](../../src/main/db/database.ts))

9. **Prototype-pollution filtering** — `__proto__` / `constructor` / `prototype`
   keys are rejected from any renderer-supplied object that is merged or used as a
   key (settings, workspace config, permission decisions, and the settings
   deep-merge).

10. **Secret redaction** — secrets and tokens (including `crsr_` Cursor keys and
    `CURSOR_API_KEY=` values) are redacted before anything reaches the logger;
    embedded-credential remote URLs are redacted from git results and logs.
    ([`logger.ts`](../../src/main/logger.ts))

11. **Encrypted secret storage** — the only credential Limboo holds on the user's
    behalf (an optional Cursor API key) lives in the safeStorage-backed
    [`SecretStore`](../../src/main/secrets/SecretStore.ts): encrypted at rest under
    `userData/secrets/`, gated on `safeStorage.isEncryptionAvailable()`, decrypted
    only at child-spawn time into the child **environment** (never argv, never IPC,
    never logs), with a stale-blob self-heal on keychain resets. The renderer sees
    only a `configured` boolean + timestamp.

## Input caps

Handlers cap renderer-supplied input lengths (prompts, commit messages, memory
bodies, branch / tag labels, clipboard / URL / notification strings) and bound output
(file reads, diff size, terminal scrollback, diagnostics ring) so a hostile or merely
enormous input cannot stall the main process or exhaust memory. The bounds live in
[`src/shared/constants.ts`](../../src/shared/constants.ts).

## Contracts for new code

Any new code that touches the OS must uphold these contracts (also in
[`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) §6):

- Validate every renderer-supplied input in the main process.
- Use bound SQL parameters only.
- Spawn with argv arrays; never `shell: true`. Validate every `cwd` / path stays
  inside the workspace before touching the filesystem.
- Apply the prototype-pollution guard to every merged or keyed renderer object.
- Encrypt any secret with Electron `safeStorage`; never plaintext files. Redact
  secrets before logging.
- For any outbound `fetch`, enforce an SSRF allowlist (block private, loopback, and
  link-local ranges; do not follow redirects to internal hosts).
